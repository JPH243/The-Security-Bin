        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Jacquilyn!</h2>
        <p> I would love to take this opportunity to thank you for stopping by my page. My name is Jacquilyn Henderson but I prefer to go by Jacqui for short. I enjoy
 listening to music, doing puzzles, playing pool, and spending time with my beautiful mother. I have a younger brother who means the world to me and a beautiful cat that
 thinks she runs the house. My dream of becoming a Cyber Security Expert started to become a reality when I signed up for the UCONN CyberSecurity Bootcamp, which taught
 me the basics for many useful cyber security programs. Through this bootcamp, I developed a strong attachment to Crpytography. I wish to pursue a more detailed career
 that utilizes Cryptography.

                <h3>To Crypt or Not to Crypt?</h3>
                <h4>Intro to Cryptography</h4>
                <p>Cybersecurity cryptography is one of the many essential aspects of protecting sensitive information in the digital age. At its heart, cryptography
 involves encrypting readable data into an unreadable format, known as ciphertext, by using complex algorithms and keys. This process ensures that only users with the
 correct decryption key can access the original information. This safeguards sensitive information from unauthorized user access. There are two main types of
 cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it quick and efficient but it
 requires a secure key distribution method. Asymmetric encryption creates a pair of keys, one public and one private, thus enhancing security by eliminating the need to
 share the private key.

 Besides encryption, cryptography also safeguards digital signatures that are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages and documents, and hashing which
 creates a unique digital fingerprint for data. These techniques are vital for ensuring that data has not been tampered with during transmission or receiving.
 Cryptography's applications can be extensive, they include securing online communications, protecting financial transactions, and safeguarding sensitive information in
 many various sectors such as healthcare and government. As cyber threats become more aggressive, the field of cryptography continues to advance by developing stronger
 algorithms and more secure protocols. Understanding the basics of cryptography is very important for anyone who is involved in cybersecurity. It provides thefoundational tools for defending against many cyber attacks and ensuring data privacy.

                <h3>Can you Caesar?</h3>
                <h4>The Caesar Cipher</h4>
                <p>The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques. The cipher received its name from none other than Julius Caesar, who used it to
 hide and protect his military communications. This simple yet ingenious method uses the shifting of each letter in the alphabet a fixed number of positions down or up the
 alphabet. For example, with a shift of five, 'A' becomes 'F', 'B' becomes 'G', and 'Z' wraps around to become 'E'. Despite its historical significance, the Caesar
 Cipher can be easily cracked by many modern standards due to its limited number of possible shifts (25).

Breaking a Caesar Cipher can be done quickly using brute-force attacks. Brute-force attacks are when each possible letter shift is attempted until the original message
 can be revealed. Another method that can be used to crack the code is frequency analysis which takes advantage of the predictable frequency of letters in a language.
 Thus making it even more simpler to decode the message. Although not secure for today's use, the Caesar Cipher is an excellent educational tool that introduces the fundamental concepts of encryption and the importance of key secrecy.

The Caesar Cipher also lays the groundwork for understanding more complex cryptographic techniques. By learning the Caesar Cipher, one gains insight into how encryption
 has evolved from ancient methods to the more modern ones we use today.Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher remains a captivating example of early cryptographic
 innovation.
